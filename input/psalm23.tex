The Lord's are the earth and its fullness, the inhabited world and all who dwell in it. He himself founded it on seas, and prepared it on rivers. Who will go up to the mountain of the Lord? Or who will stand in his holy place? One guiltless in hands and clean in heart, who has not taken his soul in vain, and who has not sworn deceitfully to his neighbor. This one will take blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his savior. This is the generation of the ones who seek the Lord, of the ones who seek the Face of the God of Jacob. Lift up the gates, your rulers, and be lifted up, eternal gates, and the King of glory will enter. Who is this, the King of glory? The Lord ruling and powerful, the Lord powerful in battle. Lift up the gates, your rulers, and be lifted up, eternal gates, and the King of glory will enter.Â Who is this, the King of glory? The Lord of powers, he is the King of glory.
