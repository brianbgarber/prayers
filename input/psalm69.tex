O God, attend to my help. Lord, assiduously hasten to help me. Let the ones who seek my soul be put to shame and embarrassment. Let be turned back and be put to shame the ones who wish me bad things. Let immediately be turned back, ashamed, the ones who say to me, Good, good. Let be gladdened and rejoice in you all who seek you, O God, and let all who love your salvation always say, The Lord be magnified. But I am poor and needy. Help me, O God. My helper and my deliverer you are, O Lord; do not delay.
