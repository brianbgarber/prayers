The Lord shepherds me, and I will lack nothing; in a place of pasture, there he has made me tabernacle. He has raised me up by water of rest, he has turned my soul back. He has led me on paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. For even though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will not fear bad things, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, these have comforted me. You have prepared a table in front of me, in front of the ones who afflict me. You have anointed my head with oil, and your cup inebriating me as one which is most strong. And your mercy will pursue me closely all the days of my life. And my dwelling is in the house of the Lord to length of days.
