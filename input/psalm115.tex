I believed, therefore I spoke. But I was greatly humbled. But I said in my ecstasy, Every man is a liar. What will I repay to the Lord for all which he has yielded to me? I will take a cup of salvation, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. I will repay my vows to the Lord before all his people. Precious in front of the Lord -- the death of his venerable ones. O Lord, I myself am your servant, I am your servant and a son of your servant girl. You broke asunder my shackles. To you I will sacrifice a sacrifice of praise, and I will call in the name of the Lord. I will repay my vows to the Lord before all his people, in the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, Jerusalem.
