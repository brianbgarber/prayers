O Lord and master of my life, take from me the spirit of sloth, despair, lust of power or idle talk. (Full prostration) But give rather the spirit of chastity, humility, patients and love to thy servant. (Full prostration) Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own transgressions, and not to judge my brother, for blessed art thou unto ages of ages. Amen (Full prostration)
