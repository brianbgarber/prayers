Holy God, Holy Might, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us \textit{(3x)}

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

O Most Holy Trinity have mercy on us. O Lord, cleanse us from our sins. O Master, pardon our transgressions. O Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for Your name's sake.

Lord have mercy. \textit{(3x)}

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
